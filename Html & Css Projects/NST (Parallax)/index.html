            <h2 class="secHead">CURRICULUM</h2>
            <p class="text">
                In the first year, students build a strong foundation in computer science through hands-on projects. They start with Python basics, covering arrays, dictionaries, file handling, and algorithms. By working on real-world applications like AI-powered image projects, a Generative AI-based CRM, and social media analyzers, they develop problem-solving skills. Additionally, they create portfolio websites, interactive games, and social media feeds, reinforcing theoretical concepts with practical experience. The curriculum encourages learning by doing, helping students gain confidence in coding. By the end of the year, they will have completed multiple projects, setting the stage for more advanced learning in later years. 
                <br><br> 

                In the later years, students progress to building complex, scalable systems. The second year focuses on data structures, discrete mathematics, and algorithms, with projects like optimizing delivery routes and developing bidding platforms. Competitive programming events enhance problem-solving skills. By the third year, students work on live-streaming platforms and collaborative tools. A mandatory six-month internship in the final year provides industry experience. The curriculum prepares students for top tech jobs or entrepreneurship, equipping them with expertise in AI, security, and large-scale systems. By graduation, they will be ready to innovate and succeed in the industry.
